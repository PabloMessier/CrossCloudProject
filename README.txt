Here is a working proof of concept of a bidirectional communication between cloud providers, in this case AWS & GCP.

This project involves an EC2 instance in AWS and a GCP VM that are able to ping each other. 
Now at this time this is a basic setup with no enhanced network capabilities like VPN and more strict firewall rules, so this is a great starting point if further enhancements are needed.

Achievements:

1. Multi-Cloud Setup:
   - Successfully created and managed resources in both AWS and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using a single Terraform configuration.
   - Demonstrated the ability to work with multiple cloud providers simultaneously.

2. Infrastructure as Code:
   - Implemented the entire infrastructure using Terraform, showcasing infrastructure-as-code best practices.
   - Created reusable and version-controlled infrastructure definitions.

3. Network Configuration:
   - Set up Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) in both AWS and GCP.
   - Configured subnets, internet gateways, and route tables in AWS.
   - Created VPC networks and subnets in GCP.

4. Security Implementation:
   - Configured security groups in AWS and firewall rules in GCP to allow necessary traffic (SSH and ICMP) while maintaining security.

5. Compute Resources:
   - Launched an EC2 instance in AWS running Amazon Linux.
   - Created a Compute Engine instance in GCP running Debian.

6. Cross-Cloud Communication:
   - Achieved bidirectional communication between the AWS and GCP instances.
   - Successfully pinged each instance from the other, demonstrating network connectivity across cloud providers.

7. SSH Access:
   - Set up SSH access to both instances, allowing for remote management and testing.

Challenges Faced and Overcome:

1. IAM and Permissions:
   - Initially encountered permission issues with the GCP service account.
   - Resolved by correctly assigning the Compute Admin and Compute Network Admin roles to the service account using gcloud CLI.

2. Image Version Update:
   - Faced an issue with an outdated Debian image version in the Terraform configuration.
   - Successfully updated the configuration to use a more recent Debian 11 image.

3. Cross-Platform Compatibility:
   - Addressed differences in command syntax between Unix-like systems and Windows PowerShell when using gcloud CLI.

4. GCP API Activation:
   - Needed to enable the Compute Engine API for the GCP project.
   - Learned the importance of activating necessary APIs before deploying resources.

5. Billing Account Setup:
   - Encountered an initial hurdle with setting up a billing account for GCP.
   - Successfully set up and linked a billing account to enable resource creation.

6. Service Account Configuration:
   - Corrected the service account email usage in gcloud commands, distinguishing between user accounts and service accounts.

7. Terraform State Management:
   - Successfully managed Terraform state across multiple cloud providers, ensuring consistent and predictable infrastructure deployments.

Overall, this project demonstrated proficiency in:
- Multi-cloud architecture design and implementation
- Infrastructure as Code using Terraform
- Cloud-specific configurations for AWS and GCP
- Networking concepts across different cloud providers
- Troubleshooting and problem-solving in a multi-cloud environment
- CLI tools usage (AWS CLI, gcloud)
- Understanding of cloud IAM and security concepts

This experience provides a solid foundation for more complex multi-cloud projects and showcases the ability to work with diverse cloud environments using a unified infrastructure-as-code approach.
